I am a PhD student at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en), currently working as a researcher at [ViRVIG](https://www.virvig.eu/) under the supervision of [Oscar Argudo](https://www.oargudo.com/) and [Carlos Andújar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=d3Vhq4YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My research focuses on augmenting complex human body animations in sports, such as bouldering, using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

My research interests lies within **character animation**, **deep reinforcement learning**, and **robotics**.

With background in both industry and research, I am committed to bridging the gap between cutting-edge research technologies and their practical applications in the industry.
