I am a PhD student at [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en), currently working as a researcher at [ViRVIG](https://www.virvig.eu/) under the supervision of [Oscar Argudo](https://www.oargudo.com/) and [Carlos Andújar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=d3Vhq4YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My research focuses on augmenting complex human body animations in sports, such as bouldering, using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

During my MSc studies, I have researched on physically-based methods for lava fluid simulations. I also contributed in a physically-based rock fracture simulation project. Additionally, I started working at the [ViRVIG](https://www.virvig.eu/) lab as a research intern for an HP project, which focused on intensive geometric algorithms for 3D printing.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from [Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/), where I worked at the IA-PUCP lab under the supervision of [Ivan Sipirán](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ca&user=53Mi3fIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works), focusing on 3D reconstruction techniques for cultural heritage using Deep Learning. Throughout these years, I had the opportunity to work as a software developer and cloud engineer at companies such as [EY](https://www.ey.com/es_pe), [Huawei](https://e.huawei.com/es/), and [Tuxpas](https://tuxpas.com/).

With a strong background in both industry and research, I am committed to bridging the gap between cutting-edge research technologies and their practical applications in the industry.
